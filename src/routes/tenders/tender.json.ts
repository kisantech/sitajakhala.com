Society at a glance :


SITAJAKHALA DUGDHA UTPADAK SAMABAI SAMITI LTD
Established: 1958 (Regd. No.67/58-59, Amlighat)
Head office: Amlighat, Dist:-Morigaon, Assam, 782410


How and why the Society was formed :


During the period of establishment, it was viewed that the Production of milk in villages surrounding Amlighat was substantial,
But the producers were deprived of a legitimate price because of an unorganized marketing system. So some socially conscious people thought about collecting the production and sell it through organized marketing. This thought was the nutshell of inspiration behind the formation of this cooperative society
